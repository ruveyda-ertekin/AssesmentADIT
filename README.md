# Household Data Organizer
The program reads and processes data from the `data.txt` file.
Only people who are 19 years or older will be listed. 
The program groups people by their address, shows each household's details, and sorts them by last name and first name.

## Why Use This Project?
This project helps to organize data by grouping people based on their addresses. 
It also sorts their names to make the information easier to read. 
You can see how many people live in each household and their details. 
Itâ€™s usable for anyone who needs to manage address data, like for reports or lists.

## Questions
1. What is the purpose of grouping people by their address? Should it be based on the address?
2. Can we add more fields about occupants to the project, like their gender?
3. Do you have any plans to add sorting options, like sorting by age or city?
4. If two people have the same first and last names, do you prefer the program to introduce a secondary criterion, like a tie-breaker criterion, for sorting such as age?
5. Is there a standard address format that should be followed like full address with postal codes?

## Test Scenarios
1. Verify that the program reads and processes data correctly from a valid `data.txt` file.
2. Verify that the program sorts people within each household by last name and first name.
3. Verify that the program handles when the `data.txt` file is missing or empty.
4. Verify that the program handles special characters and spaces in fields like addresses.
5. Verify that the program handles invalid data formats, such as missing fields or incorrect age values.
